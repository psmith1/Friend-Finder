# Friend Finder
This fun *Silicon Valley* themed application mimics the basic functionality of a BuzzFeed-style quiz or dating application. The application uses three routes built using Express.js. Two of the routes take the user to HTML pages (the homepage and the survey). The third route delivers an API containing JSON objects that store information about each of the potential character matches the user can get.
